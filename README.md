### App Description
Our application “Gai Gai” (meaning to shop in Hokkien), enables users to enjoy the window shopping experience with a simple swipe of their phone screens. It is common knowledge that e-commerce is already well-established globally. However, e-commerce sites have not quite provided consumers with an intuitive online window shopping experience, where they can casually browse through a large range of items. Instead, consumers will have to manually input a particular product or category on a specific site before scrolling through dozens of similar items. The purpose of this app is to greatly simplify this experience by presenting users with a single product at a time. The user can then swipe left to reject or swipe right to place this item into a wish list.

As a matter of fact, apps with a similar concept have been created but they are not widely used. The reason is that many of these apps focus only on a single retailer or on a particular category (most often clothing). We believe that by recreating the experience of "window shopping" on a phone and reducing the hassle of it to just a swipe of a finger, we can fulfill the "shopping itch" of consumers. This is the core idea of our product.
